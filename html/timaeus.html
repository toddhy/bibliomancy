<br>next, I am to receive the men whom he has created of whom some will
<br>have profited by the excellent education which you have given them;
<br>and then, in accordance with the tale of Solon, and equally with his
<br>law, we will bring them into court and make them citizens, as if they
<br>were those very Athenians whom the sacred Egyptian record has recovered
<br>from oblivion, and thenceforward we will speak of them as Athenians
