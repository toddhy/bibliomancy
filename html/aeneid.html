There Phoenix and Ulysses watch prey, 
<br>And thither all the wealth of Troy convey: 
<br>The spoils which they from ransack'd houses brought, 
<br>And golden bowls from burning altars caught, 
<br>The tables of the gods, the purple vests, 
<br>The people's treasure, and the pomp of priests. 
<br>A rank of wretched youths, with pinion'd hands, 
<br>And captive matrons, in long order stands. 
<br>Then, with ungovern'd madness, I proclaim, 
<br>Thro' all the silent street, Creusa's name: 
<br>Creusa still I call; at length she hears, 
<br>And sudden thro' the shades of night appears- 
<br>Appears, no more Creusa, nor my wife, 
<br>But a pale specter, larger than the life. 
<br>Aghast, astonish'd, and struck dumb with fear, 
<br>I stood; like bristles rose my stiffen'd hair. 
<br>Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief 
<br>'Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief. 
<br>Desist, my much-lov'd lord,'t indulge your pain; 
<br>You bear no more than what the gods ordain.
