<br>Thus young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace, 
<br>His temples tied, and all the Trojan race. 
<br>Aeneas then advanc'd amidst the train, 
<br>By thousands follow'd thro' the flow'ry plain, 
<br>To great Anchises' tomb; which when he found, 
<br>He pour'd to Bacchus, on the hallow'd ground, 
<br>Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more, 
<br>And two (from offer'd bulls) of purple gore, 
<br>With roses then the sepulcher he strow'd 
<br>And thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud: 
<br>"Hail, O ye holy manes! hail again, 
<br>Paternal ashes, now review'd in vain! 
<br>The gods permitted not, that you, with me, 
<br>Should reach the promis'd shores of Italy, 
<br>Or Tiber's flood, what flood soe'er it be." 
<br>Scarce had he finish'd, when, with speckled pride, 
<br>A serpent from the tomb began to glide; 
<br>His hugy bulk on sev'n high volumes roll'd;

There Phoenix and Ulysses watch prey, 
<br>And thither all the wealth of Troy convey: 
<br>The spoils which they from ransack'd houses brought, 
<br>And golden bowls from burning altars caught, 
<br>The tables of the gods, the purple vests, 
<br>The people's treasure, and the pomp of priests. 
<br>A rank of wretched youths, with pinion'd hands, 
<br>And captive matrons, in long order stands. 
<br>Then, with ungovern'd madness, I proclaim, 
<br>Thro' all the silent street, Creusa's name: 
<br>Creusa still I call; at length she hears, 
<br>And sudden thro' the shades of night appears- 
<br>Appears, no more Creusa, nor my wife, 
<br>But a pale specter, larger than the life. 
<br>Aghast, astonish'd, and struck dumb with fear, 
<br>I stood; like bristles rose my stiffen'd hair. 
<br>Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief 
<br>'Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief. 
<br>Desist, my much-lov'd lord,'t indulge your pain; 
<br>You bear no more than what the gods ordain.
