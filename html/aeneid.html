Events are doubtful, which on battles wait: 
<br>Yet where's the doubt, to souls secure of fate? 
<br>My Tyrians, at their injur'd queen's command, 
<br>Had toss'd their fires amid the Trojan band; 
<br>At once extinguish'd all the faithless name; 
<br>And I myself, in vengeance of my shame, 
<br>Had fall'n upon the pile, to mend the fun'ral flame. 
<br>Thou Sun, who view'st at once the world below; 
<br>Thou Juno, guardian of the nuptial vow; 
<br>Thou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes!
