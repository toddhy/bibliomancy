<br>
<br>When You and I behind the Veil are past, 
<br>Oh, but the long, long while the World shall last, 
<br>Which of our Coming and Departure heeds 
<br>As the Sea's self should heed a pebble-cast. 
<br>
<br>XLVIII
<br>
<br>A Moment's Halt--a momentary taste 
<br>Of Being from the Well amid the Waste-- 
<br>And Lo!--the phantom Caravan has reach'd 
<br>The Nothing it set out from--Oh, make haste! 
<br>
<br>XLIX
<br>
<br>Would you that spangle of Existence spend 
<br>About the Secret--Quick about it, Friend! 
<br>A Hair perhaps divides the False and True-- 
<br>And upon what, prithee, may life depend?
