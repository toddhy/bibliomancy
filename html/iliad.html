<br>on it were Strife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs cold;
<br>moreover there was the head of the dread monster Gorgon,, grim and
<br>awful to behold, portent of aegis-bearing Jove. On her head she set
<br>her helmet of gold, with four plumes, and coming to a peak both in
<br>front and behind- decked with the emblems of a hundred cities; then
<br>she stepped into her flaming chariot and grasped the spear, so stout
<br>and sturdy and strong, with which she quells the ranks of heroes who
<br>have displeased her. Juno lashed the horses on, and the gates of heaven
<br>bellowed as they flew open of their own accord -gates over which the
<br>flours preside, in whose hands are Heaven and Olympus, either to open
<br>the dense cloud that hides them, or to close it. Through these the
<br>goddesses drove their obedient steeds, and found the son of Saturn
<br>sitting all alone on the topmost ridges of Olympus. There Juno stayed
<br>her horses, and spoke to Jove the son of Saturn, lord of all. "Father
<br>Jove," said she, "are you not angry with Mars for these high doings?
<br>how great and goodly a host of the Achaeans he has destroyed to my

<br>and leave them. Of the two, swift Ajax son of Oileus was the first
<br>to know who it was that had been speaking with them, and said to Ajax
<br>son of Telamon, "Ajax, this is one of the gods that dwell on Olympus,
<br>who in the likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hard by our
