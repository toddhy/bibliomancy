<br>Cle. By all means. 
<br>Ath. Let us be on our guard lest this most deceptive argument with
<br>its youthful looks, beguiling us old men, give us the slip and make
<br>a laughing-stock of us. Who knows but we may be aiming at the greater,
<br>and fail of attaining the lesser? Suppose that we three have to pass
<br>a rapid river, and I, being the youngest of the three and experienced
<br>in rivers, take upon me the duty of making the attempt first by myself;
<br>leaving you in safety on the bank, I am to examine whether the river
<br>is passable by older men like yourselves, and if such appears to be
<br>the case then I shall invite you to follow, and my experience will
<br>help to convey you across; but if the river is impassable by you,
<br>then there will have been no danger to anybody but myself-would not
<br>that seem to be a very fair proposal? I mean to say that the argument
<br>in prospect is likely to be too much for you, out of your depth and
<br>beyond your strength, and I should be afraid that the stream of my
<br>questions might create in you who are not in the habit of answering,
<br>giddiness and confusion of mind, and hence a feeling of unpleasantness
<br>and unsuitableness might arise. I think therefore that I had better
<br>first ask the questions and then answer them myself while you listen
