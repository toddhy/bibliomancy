<br>3. On occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized
<br>position; on occasions of mourning, the right hand. The second in
<br>command of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding
<br>in chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is assigned to
<br>him as in the rites of mourning. He who has killed multitudes of men
<br>should weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in battle
<br>has his place (rightly) according to those rites.

<br>1. The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no name.

<br>2. Though in its primordial simplicity it may be small, the whole
<br>world dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister. If a feudal
<br>prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would spontaneously
<br>submit themselves to him.

<br>Chapter 69
<br>
<br>1. A master of the art of war has said, 'I do not dare to be the host
<br>(to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on the defensive).
<br>I do not dare to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a foot.' This
<br>is called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks; baring the
<br>arms (to fight) where there are no arms to bare; grasping the weapon
<br>where there is no weapon to grasp; advancing against the enemy where
<br>there is no enemy. 
<br>
<br>2. There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war. To do
<br>that is near losing (the gentleness) which is so precious. Thus it
<br>is that when opposing weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores
<br>(the situation) conquers.
