Thus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends, 
<br>No sage of old more bright.'

<br>Chapter 69
<br>
<br>1. A master of the art of war has said, 'I do not dare to be the host
<br>(to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on the defensive).
<br>I do not dare to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a foot.' This
<br>is called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks; baring the
<br>arms (to fight) where there are no arms to bare; grasping the weapon
<br>where there is no weapon to grasp; advancing against the enemy where
<br>there is no enemy. 
<br>
<br>2. There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war. To do
<br>that is near losing (the gentleness) which is so precious. Thus it
<br>is that when opposing weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores
<br>(the situation) conquers.
